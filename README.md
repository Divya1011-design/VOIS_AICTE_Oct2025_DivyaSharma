📊 Airbnb Data Analytics with Conversational Insights

🌟 Overview
This project, built during my internship at VOIS (Vodafone Intelligent Solutions) under the theme Conversational Data Analytics with LLMs, explores the Airbnb Open Data through data cleaning, EDA, and visualization. The goal was to extract meaningful insights that could later be used in conversational AI systems for interactive analytics.
